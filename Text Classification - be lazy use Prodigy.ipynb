    "# Text Classification: Be lazy, use Prodigy !\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Classification could be complex to tune and to implement. If your objective is satisfied with a good-enough, ready-to-production, easy-to-upgrade model, use [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) to train a smooth classifier for [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), the production-ready python framework for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is often a great exercice to deep dive into NLP technics, because you can test and apply a lot of tools: from TF-IDF to words embeddings, training your own doc2vec/word2vec, applying some classic classifiers, testing neural net like RNN, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, you can spent **HUGE** time to build-up your classification strategy and to improve your algorithms: you will augment your data, create new features, try new tricks to increase the accuracy of your models, etc. It's endless. If you're lucky, you will find the gold feature to kick-up your model on your specific data, and if you're even more lucky, a secret sauce to generalize it on a wider domain.\n",
    "But it's hard. Sometime, it's really specific to your business domain (it could depend on the used vocabulary, the size of sentences, etc.) and it usually takes time to be tuned… that could be not compatible with a production environment where you have to quickly provide several classifiers and maintain them in time.\n",
    "Then, If your objective will be satisfied with a good-enough (i.e. not 0.9999), ready-to-production, easy-to-upgrade model, I suggest to test and use Prodigy to train a classification model usable with spaCy, the production-ready python framework for NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Prodigy\n",
    "As explained by its creators, [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) is : \n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "an annotation tool so efficient that data scientists can do the annotation themselves, enabling a new level of rapid iteration. Whether you’re working on entity recognition, intent detection or image classification, Prodigy can help you train and evaluate your models faster. Stream in your own examples or real-world data from live APIs, update your model in real-time and chain models together to build more complex systems.\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "So Prodigy will provide you web interfaces to tag you data (texts, images, etc.) but also command lines to train new models. That's this last part I will use in my example to train a text classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Description : Spooky Competition\n",
    "For my example, I am using the dataset provided by the [Spooky Kaggle Competition](), where the objective was to predict the author of excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe (EAP), Mary Shelley (MWS), and HP Lovecraft (HPL).\n",
    "The tagging is already done, so I do not have to use the Prodigy's web interface for this time being (which is great, by the way!).\n",
    "\n",
    "What I have to do is:\n",
    "- To prepare the Data for Prodigy,\n",
    "- Build the dataset for prodigy,\n",
    "- and train a new model using the tool\n",
